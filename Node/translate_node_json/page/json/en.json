It is still unknown which animals were the ancestors. On the picture It is clear that the Burmese is similar in color to the Siamese, but in character it is its complete opposite. Calm, inquisitive animals do not hesitate to express their love for their owners and at the same time, like true aristocrats, will not impose their society if people are busy and cannot pay attention to them."

Royally beautiful appearance combined with a friendly character is the perfect example of a family pet. The older they get, the more royal habits appear in them. They perfectly sense the mood of their household: plunge into thoughtful contemplation when the owners need peace and quiet, actively support the game if required\r\nsituation."

They are balanced and reasonable, like real northern residents."
